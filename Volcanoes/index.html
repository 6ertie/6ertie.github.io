				<h1>Overview</h1>

				<p>Volcanoes come in many varieties: Shield, Cinder Cone, Composite Cone, Lava Plateau and Caldera. Of these, the three most common volcanoes and the focus of this site will be on the Shield, Cinder Cone and Composite Cone. These three types are similar in that they form a conical shape. Despite this similarity, these volcano types do differ subtly in appearance and behavior due to their mineral composition and substantially in size. The shield, composite, and cinder cone volcano will be the focus of this website.</p>

				<p>When a volcano erupts, it emits hot water vaper, gases, lava, and rock fragments. Volcano types vary based on size, shape, mineral composition and eruptive behavior. This site will discuss the differences between the three major volcano types.  Also available is a short-listed chronology of a few eruptions from around the world.</p>
