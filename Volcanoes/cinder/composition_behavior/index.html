				<h2>Composition</h2>

				<p>Cinder cones are made from piles of loose rock fragments created from lava that is emitted outwardly like a fountain and then solidifies into bits of lava rock that drop back to the surface.</p>

				<p>Cinder cones are also referred to as “pyroclastic cones” - because they can emit pyroclastic material - and as “scoria cones” - because the rock debris produced is igneous with a structure made of bubble-like cavities.</p>

				<h2>Behavior</h2>

				<p>Cinder cones are generally built from single eruptions although these events can last several years.  Once the eruption slows, the cones eventually quiet down.  Although lava typically spews out like a fountain from its vent, it can also flow out from base, signally the end of the volcanic activity.</p>
