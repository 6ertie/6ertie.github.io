				<h1>Shield Volcano</h1>

				<p>Shield volcanoes are named as such due to their appearance.  These volcanoes are the gentle giants of the three volcano types. They are not steep but very large and broad. Some of the best examples of shield volcanoes can be found in Hawaii and Iceland.</p>

				<p>Mauna Loa located in Hawaii is the tallest mountain in the world at 30,080' if you count measuring it from the ocean floor to its peak. Compare that to the tallest mountain in the world, Mount Everest at 29,029' elevation. Otherwise, Mauna Loa, from sea-level has an elevation of 13,678 feet. Mauna Loa is the largest volcano in the world and makes up part of the largest and youngest of the Hawaiian Islands – the Big Island - along with its sibling, Mauna Kea.</p>
